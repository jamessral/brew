# Softbrew

Softbrew is a fork of Linuxbrew, a fork of Homebrew, the Mac OS package manager, for Android. Softbrew will use the Ruboto Android Ruby environment. Check them out and contribute to them as well!

It will be installed in your home directory and does not require root access. The same package manager can be used on both your Android device and your Mac laptop.

Proposed Features
--------

+ Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
+ Install software not packaged by the native distribution
+ Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
+ Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines

# Want to Contribute?
+ In order to make this project work, it will need many more contributors to successfully port to Android. Want to get involved? Email me at jamessral@gmail.com if you are interested. 
+ Have pointers? I could use any advice that you can give!
